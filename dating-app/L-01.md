### [L-01] ETH May Become Permanently Locked in LikeRegistry

**Description:**

The LikeRegistry contract may lock ETH permanently if funds are sent to it outside of `LikeRegistry::likeUser()`, as the contract only tracks ETH collected through this function.

The issue arises because `LikeRegistry::withdrawFees()` attempts to transfer only the amount tracked in `totalFees`, rather than the actual ETH balance of the contract. Any ETH received outside of the expected flow will not be withdrawable, causing it to be locked.

```javascript
    function withdrawFees() external onlyOwner {
        require(totalFees > 0, "No fees to withdraw");
        uint256 totalFeesToWithdraw = totalFees;

        totalFees = 0;
@>      (bool success, ) = payable(owner()).call{value: totalFeesToWithdraw}(
            ""
        );
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }
```

**Impact:**

Low – No user funds are lost, and protocol functionality remains unaffected. However, if ETH is mistakenly sent to the contract in an unexpected way, it will become permanently locked since withdrawFees() does not allow the owner to withdraw funds beyond the tracked totalFees.

**Proof of Concept:**

In the test below, a user sends 1 ETH directly to the contract. Since totalFees is not updated, the owner is unable to withdraw this ETH.
```javascript
    function testSendEthAndWithdraw() public {
        LikeRegistry likeRegistry;
        address user = address(0x123);
        address owner = makeAddr("owner"); // Test contract acts as the owner

        uint256 public constant STARTING_USER_BALANCE = 10e18;
        likeRegistry.transferOwnership(owner);
        vm.deal(user, STARTING_USER_BALANCE);


        vm.startPrank(user);
        (bool success, ) = payable(address(likeRegistry)).call{value: 1 ether}(
            ""
        );
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
        assertEq(address(likeRegistry).balance, 1 ether);
        assertEq(likeRegistry.totalFees(), 0);

        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        //No fees to withdraw
        likeRegistry.withdrawFees();
    }
```

**Recommended Mitigation:**

Modify withdrawFees() to withdraw the contract’s actual balance rather than the tracked totalFees:
```diff
    function withdrawFees() external onlyOwner {
-       require(totalFees > 0, "No fees to withdraw");
+       require(address(this).balance > 0, "No fees to withdraw");
-       uint256 totalFeesToWithdraw = totalFees;

        totalFees = 0;
-       (bool success, ) = payable(owner()).call{value: totalFeesToWithdraw}(
+       (bool success, ) = payable(owner()).call{value: address(this).balance}(
            ""
        );
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }
```
This ensures that any ETH held by the contract, regardless of how it was received, can be withdrawn, preventing funds from becoming permanently locked.
