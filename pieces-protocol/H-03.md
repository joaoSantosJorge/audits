### [H-03] The contract `TokenDivider` can have eth locked

**Description:**
The TokenDivider contract can unintentionally lock ETH when users send more than the required amount to fulfill a buy order. The excess ETH remains in the contract and cannot be withdrawn, as no mechanism exists to handle or refund the surplus.

**Impact:**

High. This behavior can lead to user funds being irretrievably locked, which is not the expected functionality and can harm user trust and experience.

**Proof of Concept:**

Consider a scenario where a user sends 2 ETH to fulfill an order requiring only 1 ETH. The excess 1 ETH remains trapped in the contract.
```javascript
    function testMyBuyOrder() public {
        vm.startPrank(USER);
        erc721Mock.approve(address(tokenDivider), TOKEN_ID);
        tokenDivider.divideNft(address(erc721Mock), TOKEN_ID, AMOUNT);

        ERC20Mock erc20Mock = ERC20Mock(
            tokenDivider.getErc20InfoFromNft(address(erc721Mock)).erc20Address
        );
        erc20Mock.approve(address(tokenDivider), AMOUNT);
        tokenDivider.sellErc20(address(erc721Mock), 1e18, AMOUNT);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(USER2);
        tokenDivider.buyOrder{value: (2e18)}(0, address(USER));
        vm.stopPrank();

        //check erc20 balance decreases in USER
        assertEq(tokenDivider.getBalanceOf(USER, address(erc20Mock)), 0);
        //check erc20 balance is increased in USER2
        assertEq(tokenDivider.getBalanceOf(USER2, address(erc20Mock)), AMOUNT);

        //check contract balance is zero
        assertEq(address(tokenDivider).balance, 0);
    }
```

**Recommended Mitigation:**

You have two options:
1. send back the surplus of eth
```javascript
    uint256 requiredAmount = order.price + sellerFee;

    uint256 excessAmount = msg.value - requiredAmount;

    if (excessAmount > 0) {
        (bool refundSuccess, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: excessAmount}("");
        require(refundSuccess, "Refund failed");
    }
```
2. or require the user to send the exact amount of eth when fullfiling the buy order.
```javascript
    uint256 requiredAmount = order.price + fee;
    require(msg.value == requiredAmount, "Exact ETH required");
```
