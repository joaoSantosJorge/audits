### [M-04] conflict in buy orders

**Description:**

Users that simultaneously try to buy the same order may end up being defrauded. Because the orders are stored at `TokenDivider::s_userToSellOrders` and do not have a unique identifier, two different users may try to buy the same order at the same time. One of the users may end up with less tokens than expected.

**Impact:**

Medium: Worst case, if the order goes through, the user ends up with a different order than he wanted.

**Recommended Mitigation:**

Introduce unique identifiers to orders.
